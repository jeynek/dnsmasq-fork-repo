  #   description: |
  #     The addon can detect whether the server which is running the addon has just rebooted;
  #     if that's the case and the following flag is set to "true", then the DHCP lease database
  #     is reset before starting the DHCP server; this is useful in case a loss of power of the
  #     HomeAssistant server means also a loss of power of several/all DHCP clients. In such a case
  #     the old DHCP lease database is not useful and actually misleading.
